/* [WhoWantstoBeaMillionaire]
 * This program that prompts the user for the answers to 15 questions, with 3 for each level in randomized order. It is the user's objective to get ALL the questions correct to win ONE [fake] MILLION DOLLARS.
 * All the questions are formatted in multiple choice (a, b, c, or d). The level of difficulty increases after each question and an increase in winning earnings.
 * If the user misses a question, it is the game is over. There are three 'lifelines' (50/50, Poll the Audience, Ask An Expert) at the user's disposal, but each can only be used once during the course of the game. 
 * The User can quit whenever they want, and walk away with their previous winnings by entering 'q'. At the end, if they win the million dollars, they have the option to play again (y - yes or n - no)
